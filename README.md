# Hard to Read and Understand Pythonic Idioms? DeIdiom and Explain Them in Non-Idiomatic Equivalent Code

 ## Appendices:
Appendices.pdf is the supplementary document.


 ## Web application: 
We develop a web application for demostration of deidioming pythonic code into explanatory non-idiomatic code to enhance the readability of nine pythonic idioms (list/set/dict-comprehension, chain-comparison, truth-value-test, loop-else, assign-multiple-targets, for-multiple-targets and star). Please visit http://35.77.46.3:5000.
	

 ## Code:
	
	1). code/extract_idiom_code_new:
	  
	    Extracting idiomatic code for nine pythonic idioms.
	
	2).  code/transform_s_c: 
	
	    Refactoring idiomatic code into non-idiomatic code for nine pythonic idioms.
	
	3).  ./code/test_case_idiom_s_c:
	 
	    Configuring projects and executing test cases for nine pythonic idioms.
	
	

 ## Data:

	1). data/all_idiomatic_to_nonidiomatic/:
	  
	    All code pairs of idiomatic code and the corresponding non-idiomatic code for nine pythonic idioms.
	
	2). data/motivation/: 
	
	    All results of Section 2 (EMPRICAL STUDY).
	
	3).  data/effectiveness/:
	 
	    All results of Section 4.1 (Refactoring Accuracy).
	
	4). data/survey/: 
	
	    The notes documentation, all questions, and answers of 20 participants of Section 4.2 (Refactoring Usefulness).
